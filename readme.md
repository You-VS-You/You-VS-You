Discipline for Men: You VS You

Discipline is everything. No streaks, no gimmicks, no shortcuts—just brutal accountability designed to push you to take action, every single day. You don’t need another habit tracker. You need a wake-up call that forces you to own your actions and eliminate excuses.

How It Works:
	•	Three Daily Reality Checks – Fixed notifications at 9:00, 15:00, and 21:00 that force you to reflect, commit, and act. No skipping. No excuses. 15:00 time asks "how productive you are today?" with a slider from 0 to 100%. 21:00 time asks "how many hours did you waste today" with slider fom 0 to 12hours in 0.5h increments.
	•	Discipline percentage is calculated by taking the total number of questions answered in the day, and calculating answers that were positive. all positive = 100% discipline
	•	Brutal, No-Nonsense Questions – Answer hard-hitting questions that expose weakness and demand accountability. Every response moves you forward or sets you back.
	•	Minimalist, Distraction-Free Interface – No unnecessary features, no endless scrolling. Answer, commit, and get back to work.
	•	No Habit Tracking – Just Discipline – No streaks, no rewards, no “progress bars.” Either you step up, or you don’t.
	•	Instant Feedback – Weak responses will be called out. Strong responses push you further. You can lie to yourself, but this app won’t let you.
